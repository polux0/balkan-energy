note to myself: 

1. when running new migrations change /config/config.js file to connect on 33061 port, in every other case it will not work ( it works on 3306 );


list:

1. extend previously used containers and create different enviornment in order to be compatible
with sequelize;
2. create connection pooling in `config.js`


progress: 


1. /
2. /


another: 

0. insert countries from email to the database, and change logic according to it - countries should be 1st 3 letters, not 2 ( as it is now ); 
0.1. modify insertion scripts for auctions - > should insert null if value is !number;
1. auctions-auto represents daily auctions; copy-paste same logic ( including migration for model, controller, utils ) for
auction-monthly and auction-yearly;
2. change name of /util/scripts/auctions-auto to auction-daily-downloaded; same for the others;
