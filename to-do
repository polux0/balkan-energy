note to myself: 

1. when running new migrations change /config/config.js file to connect on 33061 port, in every other case it will not work ( it works on 3306 );


list:

1. extend previously used containers and create different enviornment in order to be compatible
with sequelize;
2. create connection pooling in `config.js`


progress: 


1. /
2. /
